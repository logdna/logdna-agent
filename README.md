LogDNA's collector agent which streams log files to your LogDNA account. LogDNA is a hosted, cloud logging service.

## Getting Started

### From an Official Release

Check out the official [LogDNA site](https://logdna.com/) on how to signup for an account and get started.

### From Source

Follow these quick instructions to run the LogDNA agent from source:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/logdna/logdna-agent.git
cd logdna-agent
npm install

# help
sudo node index.js --help

# configure
sudo node index.js -k <YOUR LOGDNA INGESTION KEY>
# On Linux, this will generate a config file: /etc/logdna.conf
# On Windows, this will generate a config file: C:\ProgramData\logdna\logdna.conf

# on Linux, /var/log is monitored/added by default (recursively), optionally specify more folders
# on Windows, C:\ProgramData\logs is monitored/added by default (recursively), optionally specify more folders
sudo node index.js -d /path/to/log/folders -d /path/to/2nd/folder
sudo node index.js -d /var/log                            # folder only assumes *.log + extensionless files
sudo node index.js -d "/var/log/*.txt"                    # supports glob patterns
sudo node index.js -d "/var/log/**/*.txt"                 # *.txt in any subfolder
sudo node index.js -d "/var/log/**/myapp.log"             # myapp.log in any subfolder
sudo node index.js -d "/var/log/+(name1|name2).log"       # supports extended glob patterns
sudo node index.js -e /var/log/nginx/error.log            # exclude specific files from -d
sudo node index.js -f /usr/local/nginx/logs/access.log    # add specific files
sudo node index.js -t production                          # tags
sudo node index.js -t production,app1=/opt/app1           # tags for specific paths
sudo node index.js -w System                              # Windows System event logs (all providers)
sudo node index.js -w EventLog/Security                   # EventLog provider's Security logs
sudo node index.js -w EventLog/*                          # all logs from EventLog provider
sudo node index.js -w WinEvent/* -w EventLog/System       # all WinEvent, just System from EventLog
sudo node index.js -w EventLog/System,ESENT/System        # System logs (from ESENT or EventLog provider)
sudo node index.js -w System,ESENT/*                      # All Systems logs and logs from ESENT provider

# other commands
sudo node index.js -l                                     # show all saved options from config
sudo node index.js -l tags,key,logdir                     # show specific entries from config
sudo node index.js -u tags                                # unset tags
sudo node index.js -u tags,logdir                         # unset tags and logdir
sudo node index.js -u all                                 # unset everything except ingestion key

# start the agent
sudo node index.js
```

### Configuration File

Normally a config file is automatically generated (e.g. when you set a key using `-k`), but you can create your own config file `/etc/logdna.conf` on Linux and `C:\ProgramData\logdna\logdna.conf` on Windows:

```conf
logdir = /var/log/myapp,/path/to/2nd/dir
key = <YOUR LOGDNA INGESTION KEY>
```
On Windows, you can use Windows paths, just make sure to use `\\` as a separator:

```conf
logdir = C:\\Users\\username\\AppData\\myapp
key = <YOUR LOGDNA INGESTION KEY>
```

#### Options
* `logdir`: sets the paths that the agent will monitor for new files, separate multiple paths using `,`, supports glob patterns + specific files. By default this option is set to monitor .log and extensionless files under `/var/log/`. Glob patterns should be given in double-quotes.
* `exclude`: excludes files that otherwise would've matched `logdir`, separate multiple excludes using `,`, supports glob patterns + specific files
* `exclude_regex`: filters out any lines matching pattern in any file. Don't include leading and trailing /.
* `key`: your LogDNA Ingestion Key. You can obtain one by creating an account on [LogDNA site](https://logdna.com/) and once logged in to the webapp, click the Gear icon, then Account Profile.
* `tags`: use tags to separate data for production, staging, or autoscaling use cases
* `hostname`: override os hostname
* `autoupdate`: sets whether the agent should update itself when new versions are available on the public repo (default is `1`, set to `0` to disable)
* `winevent`: sets Windows Event Log Configurations in `[provider]/logname` format, `provider` being optional:
  * `*/<logname>` or `<logname>`: logname from all providers (ie: `System`, `Application`)
  * `<provider>/*`: all lognames from this `provider`
  * `<provider>/<logname>`: just this logname from this `provider`


### Features
* Agent maintains persistent connections to LogDNA ingestion servers with HTTPS encryption
* Reconnects if disconnected and will queue up new log lines while disconnected
* Compression on upload (currently gzip)
* Rescans for new files in all `logdir` paths, every minute
* Transparently handles log rotated files in most OS's (supports: renamed, truncated & "new file per day" log rotation methods)
* [Init script is available here](https://github.com/logdna/logdna-agent/blob/master/scripts/init-script) (rpm/deb packages already include this)
* Agent is self-updating to latest point releases, no need to maintain latest versions (this requires LogDNA YUM/APT repo to be installed)
```
# YUM Repo
echo "[logdna]
name=LogDNA packages
baseurl=http://repo.logdna.com/el6/
enabled=1
gpgcheck=0" | sudo tee /etc/yum.repos.d/logdna.repo

# APT Repo
echo "deb http://repo.logdna.com stable main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/logdna.list
wget -O- https://s3.amazonaws.com/repo.logdna.com/logdna.gpg | sudo apt-key add -
sudo apt-get update
```

## How it Works

The LogDNA agent authenticates using your [LogDNA Ingestion Key](https://app.logdna.com/manage/profile) and opens a secure web socket to LogDNA's ingestion servers. It then 'tails' for new log data, as well as watches for new files added to your specific logging directories.

## Kubernetes Logging

Set up Kubernetes logging with 2 `kubectl` commands with the LogDNA agent! We extract pertinent Kubernetes metadata: pod name, container name, container id, namespace, and labels etc:

```
kubectl create secret generic logdna-agent-key --from-literal=logdna-agent-key=<YOUR LOGDNA INGESTION KEY>
kubectl create -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/logdna/logdna-agent/master/logdna-agent-ds.yaml
```

This automatically installs a logdna-agent pod into each node in your cluster and ships stdout/stderr from all containers, both application logs and node logs. Note: By default, the agent pod will collect logs from all namespaces on each node, including `kube-system`. View your logs at https://app.logdna.com. See [YAML file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/logdna/logdna-agent/master/logdna-agent-ds.yaml) for additional options such as `LOGDNA_TAGS`.

If you don't have a LogDNA account, you can create one on https://logdna.com or if you're on macOS w/[Homebrew](https://brew.sh) installed:

```
brew cask install logdna-cli
logdna register <email>
# now paste the Ingestion Key into the kubectl commands above
```

We created this integration mainly based on customer feedback and that [logging with Kubernetes should not be this painful](https://blog.logdna.com/2017/03/14/logging-with-kubernetes-should-not-be-this-painful/).
